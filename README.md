# CubeGame

A 3D Unity project made by following and tinkering with [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL)

After I completed the tutorial, which involved creating basic three levels for the runner, I added an endless mode where blocks spawn and move towards the player
